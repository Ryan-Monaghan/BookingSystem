# BookingSystem
This project was an end of year Java assignment, here are the project brief details:
A start-up recording studio is proving successful. They are receiving many emails each
day but often these emails are short of necessary information. To avoid
this, they wish to you develop a Java application to process bookings.
When applying to use the studio, the following information must be
provided:
 a contact name, a email and mobile phone number for the group's
manager
 the names and instruments of each musician in the group
 the preferred payment method – Credit Card (5% levy), Cheque, or Cash (5%
reduction in bill)
 the preferred start-date
The studio can accommodate up to 8 musicians.
The studio charges include a sound engineer. Session musicians cost €100 each per day
and requests for musicians should be included in the booking request. These extra
musicians must be included in the 8 above.
The studio bills as follows:
 1 day: €260
 2-4 days @ €240 per day
 5 - 8 days @ €210 per day
 9 days or longer @€200 per day
When the user provides the information, the application should create a suitably
formatted booking request.
All code must be commented, use meaningful identifiers and avoid magic numbers.
Validate all numeric input.
